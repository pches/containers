## Notes

As building containers requires host root access, containers for Roar must be built on a VM host dedicated to building singularity containers, singbuild.vmhost.psu.edu.

Notes for these builds are available via the ICDS Bookstack document, "Building R Containers with VM Host Singbuild" available via the ICDS internal website 
https://bookstack.hpc.psu.edu/books/jeffnucciarone/page/building-r-containers-with-vm-host-singbuild.
